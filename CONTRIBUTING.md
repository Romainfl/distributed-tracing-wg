# Governance and Contribution to the Distributed Tracing working group

This document describes the contribution and governance rules for the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). This includes the following specifications

- [Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context)
- [Correlation Context](https://github.com/w3c/correlation-context)

## Meetings
In order to provide equitable rights to all members, the following process will be followed:

- Official conference calls are held on a bi-weekly basis and are announced on a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dynatrace.com_5a09qhua6fh7jb23h7vdjg6veg%40group.calendar.google.com)
- Official face-to-face meetings will be announced at least 4 weeks in advance.
- Proposed changes to any document MUST be handled via a Pull Request (PR). If the change came up during a meeting the meeting owner is responsible for creating the PR.
- PRs will be reviewed during official meetings, but off-line reviews (LGTMs, NOT LGTMs) and comments are strongly encouraged to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting.
- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for a vote over those that appear to require discussions.
- PRs should not be merged if they have had substantial changes made within two days of the meeting. Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial. Note, administrivia PRs that do not materially modify output documents may be processed by admins as needed.
- Resolving PRs ("merging" or "closing with no action") will be done as a result of a motion made during a meeting, and approved.
- Reopening a PR can be done if new information is made available, and a motion to do so is approved.
- Any motion that does not have "unanimous consent" will result in a formal vote. See Voting.


## Participation  
There are three categories of project participation:

1. Non Working Group Member. This is anyone who  participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). In contrast to Working Group members they can file a PR but not vote on a PR. They can, however, create issues for specifcations. 
2. Working Group Member. This is anyone who officially participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). Working group members can file PRs against documents and can participate in the PR voting procedure. Working Group members need to be employed by a W3C member organization or participate as invited experts. 
3. Chairs and Co-Chairs are members of the group but have the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the group. For example, manage the website, github repos and moderate the meetings. Their actions should be done with the knowledge and consent of the group. They also have the ability to merge/close PRs, but only per the group's approval. 

## PRs and Voting
Specificaiton changes are proposed via PRs which are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being merged:

- The author of the PR indicates that it is ready for review by asking for it to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda document.
- All comments have been addressed.
- PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed in dedicated by interested parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.

Every member of the working group is encouraged to vote with a statement of support and dissent on any PR. If a member has concerns regarding a PR they are encouraged to comment on the issue and join in discussions. If a member does reply to a comment within a reasonable timeframe - one business week - the comment is considered properly addressed. 

The goal of the working group is to reach consensus by discussion. If consensus cannot be reached the [W3C Voting rules](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Votes) apply.
