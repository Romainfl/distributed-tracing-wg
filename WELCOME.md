# Join Distributed Tracing Working Group

We welcome you to join Distributed Tracing working group. This group works on
standards to improve monitoring and troubleshooting of modern distributed
applications also known as micro-services. These standards will help web
framework developers, web servers, proxies and load balancers as well as tracing
vendors.

There are many ways to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to specifications developed
by this working group and the future of distributed tracing. Prototype and
provide feedback, improve test coverage, join working group meetings, review
specs, and promote them.

If the company you work for is a member of W3C - officially joining working
group is a best way to promote your work. Listing company as a [group
participant](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=108594&order=org&public=1)
makes your company contribution and endorsement more discoverable. And, as a
result, specifications produced by group more credible.

Also joining the group will allow you to vote on major decisions and influence
this group charter.
