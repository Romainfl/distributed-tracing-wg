# W3C Privacy Interest Group (PING) call

**Date:** Thursday 29 November at UTC 17

Presented:

- Philippe Le Hegaret 
- Sergey Kanzhelev

W3C PING reviewed trace context specification and gave the feedback. No major
issues were raised. Few action items from this meeting:

1. Comment on the use of trace context headers in response and potential risks
   for cross-origin calls. Created
   [issue](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/issues/209).
2. Suggestion on how one can audit randomness of `trace-id` and `span-id`.
   Discussion [topic](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/issues/210) created.
3. Conversation on why traces need to start with clients (User Agents) is
   unclear and probably should be continued.
4. There should be another in-depth thinking when/if browsers will be willing to
   support it natively.
